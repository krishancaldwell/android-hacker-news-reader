# Android Hacker News Reader

Data pulled from HNPWA API at https://github.com/tastejs/hacker-news-pwas/blob/master/docs/api.md

As published on their Github page, using the official Hacker News API does not have an ideal structure for making a fast loading app.


## Future
* Improve UI
* Add bookmarks
* Add further pages (ie Jobs, Ask, etc)
* Switch datasource to the original Hacker News source since there appears to be some time delay
